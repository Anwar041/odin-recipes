        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        is the Greek lucky new year's cake that has a coin hidden in it and is cut at midnight.
         It is tradition for each family to have their own vasilopita and a piece is cut for each family member.
          If the coin is in your piece you supposedly have good luck for the rest of the year.

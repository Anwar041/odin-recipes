First HTML project on GITHUB
What is it about ?
This project is an HTML based one, where i have to create a site with recipes using HTML only. 
The site won't look pretty but it will reflect all my knowledge.

What do i need to know before starting to work on the project?
I have to know basic HTML coding, like lists, headings, boilerplate, mark important stuff and 
creating paragraphs for each part of the recipe. So basically the basics and root to HTML and web
Development. I also learn how to work more with Git and GITHUB.

End of project, what have i learned after completing the project?
I realized that i still have to work with GITHUB and git. I had troubles at the beginning finding out when and what i should commit
but after a while i think i made it work. I don't know if what i did was right but i'll find out in the future.

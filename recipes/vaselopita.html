    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
    is the Greek lucky new year's cake that has a coin hidden in it and is cut at midnight.
     It is tradition for each family to have their own vasilopita and a piece is cut for each family member.
      If the coin is in your piece you supposedly have good luck for the rest of the year.
